# Human-in-the-loop Reinforcement Learning for Emotion Recognition

## ✏️ Description
Introduces a novel approach, two-state Q-learning with human feedback (TS-QL-HF) that uses Q-learning and human feedback to improve the accuracy of a facial emotion recognition system without requiring tremendous amount of data on minority population, ensuring fairness regardless of race or medical conditions.
