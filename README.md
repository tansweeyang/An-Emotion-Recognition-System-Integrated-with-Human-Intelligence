# Human-in-the-loop Reinforcement Learning for Emotion Recognition

## ✏️ Description
Introduces a enhanced approach called two-state Q-learning with human feedback (TS-QL-HF) that uses Q-learning and human feedback to improve the accuracy of facial emotion recognition systems without requiring tremendous amount of data on minority population, ensuring fairness when building such systems.
