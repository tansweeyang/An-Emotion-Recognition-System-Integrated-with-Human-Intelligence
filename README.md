# Human-in-the-loop Reinforcement Learning for Emotion Recognition
Introduces a novel approach called two-state Q-learning(TS-QL-HF) that uses Q-learning and human feedback that improves the accuracy of an facial emotion recognition(FER) system.
- TS-QL-HF is shown to outperform the traditional TS-QL approach in accuracy.
